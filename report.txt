toylang.py:

Starting out, when setting up my code, I copied over my Env() code from ImpLang, and made no revisions to it. 

My Eval interpreter followed a similar structure to previous Eval interpreters I have implemented, which feature the same standard operation 
functions for adding, subtracting, etc. I invoked the Closure class for my func and created a function in Env() that does a deep copy of env, which is passed into Closure.

When conducting an initial test of my code, I encountered this error:
mpenner@MattBook:~/358/assign4$ python3 toylang.py < tst/add1.toy
{ var add = lambda x: lambda y: x+y;
  print(add(1)(2))
}
'method' object does not support item assignment

The fix for this was to initialize env in the Eval constructor to avoid ambiguity.  When running the code again, I got this error:
mpenner@MattBook:~/358/assign4$ python3 toylang.py < tst/add2.toy
{ var x = 1;
  var y = 2;
  var add = lambda x: lambda y: x+y;
  print(add(x)(y))
}
'Tree' object has no attribute 'env'

I realized that to mitigate this issue, I needed to add a global env to the call function instead.  This, combined with the rest of the Eval functions ported over from ImpLang, were able to make
the output be as intended.

toylang2.py:

To start out, I copied over the code from toylang to operate as my base.
